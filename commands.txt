conda activate gun_detection_robo

To perform inference on all the images in a folder using YOLOv8 and your trained model (best.pt), you can use the source argument with the folder path. YOLOv8 will automatically process all the images in that folder.

Here's the command:

yolo detect predict model=best.pt source=path_to_test_folder

Command for testing on a video:

yolo detect predict model=best.pt source=path_to_video.mp4
